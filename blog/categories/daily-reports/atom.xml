    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was an OK day. I got to work a little late, but I immediately completed my Project01 task in about ten minutes. I then wasted a few hours before having a quality afternoon working on Project02. I probably had four hours of effective work in about seven hours at the office. I was hoping to find some productivity software that would allow me to clock in and clock out and formalize the accounting of my time. I never got around to it, so I will have to do that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I also looked on Craigslist and applied for other "gigs" in town. I'm hoping to pick up some more temporary work that will enable me to make a few dollars and gain some experience with different types of projects. At the very least, I'll get better at applying for jobs and meeting new people, which is something I should be better at than I am.</p>

<p>This evening I played basketball for a couple hours which was nice. My current weight makes it quite hard on my legs and knees, but I have to start somewhere. It was a bit rough because I still have a bit of a cold, but I was able to get up and down the court OK.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm not going to put my weight in the individual reports anymore as it is much easier to input and use if I put them in a spreadsheet. You can find this under the <a href="http://halfnobody.github.com/goals">Goals tab</a> above.</p>

<p>Today was an OK first day back at work. My boss had no work for me today, so all of my time was self-directed time. I spent a good chunk of the morning working on tasks for Project01, but I was working in a task-based manner instead of a time-based manner, which wasn't ideal. I accomplished the tasks without losing too much focus. In the afternoon, I did SEO and Adwords research for Project02 and I learned some interesting things about SEO from chapter 4 of the seomoz beginner's guide. I did this in a time-based manner, but it was quite difficult and I didn't stop at the time that I had decided to stop. This time-based task completion is much easier said than done.</p>

<p>All in all, I probably had about three hours of effective time in the six or so hours I was at the office. Tomorrow I will look for some kind of productivity widget that will allow me to clock in and clock out to more successfully measure my productive time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Weight: 235.2</h4>

<p>I didn't accomplish much today. I have a bit of a cold and I had the day off. I got this blog up and running and I helped take down Christmas decorations, but other than that, I just stayed in bed reading things on the internet and watching TV all day. I also did a fair amount of thinking about my goals which I will write about in another post. That is all.</p>
