    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, here&#8217;s the update&#8230; things have not been going well. I&#8217;ve basically spent a week in bed accomplishing almost nothing. This prospective freelance projects where I might get paid if things go well aren&#8217;t getting me out of bed. I stay awake until I fall asleep from exhaustion (sometime around five or six in the morning) and then I wake up when one of my parents gets sick of me sleeping all day (sometime around noon or two in the afternoon). In the last week I beat Portal and Portal 2 and watched four seasons of a television show. I feel terrible all the time.</p>

<p>Right now I need a job. I need structure. I need a place to go everyday and a time that I have to be there and something to accomplish and someone to check on me to make sure I&#8217;m accomplishing something. Also, getting paid would be nice. The main problem is that there&#8217;s currently no jobs that I&#8217;m &#8220;qualified&#8221; to fulfill. Here&#8217;s a breakdown:</p>

<h4>Why I should be employable</h4>

<ul>
<li>I know the basics of many programming languages and technologies from low level embedded systems work up to web development and I&#8217;m pretty good at a couple of them.</li>
<li>I am a dynamite IT guy with proven experience pulling cables and lots of personal time spent fixing computers and setting up networks.</li>
<li>I am easily in the top 2% of the quickest learners I&#8217;ve ever met.</li>
<li>I am an intelligent, clean-cut, well spoken, white male. Seriously, isn&#8217;t getting a job supposed to be easy for me?</li>
</ul>


<h4>Why nobody wants to employ me</h4>

<ul>
<li>I have no degrees or certificates.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve never had a programming job or completed a large enough programming project to prove to anyone that I can do it.</li>
<li>I am <em>very</em> bad at networking.</li>
</ul>


<p>An ideal situation for me would be some kind of internship or apprenticeship where I would work on a team and be able to learn on the job. I would even be willing to work for a lower salary until I&#8217;m up to speed as my expenses are very low right now. Anyways, I&#8217;m starting to seriously look at jobs that are completely outside the computing world, but at least they&#8217;ll give me a paycheck and a place to be.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, this reporting thing isn&#8217;t really working. Today sucked again. I got up on time to make it to my appointment a little bit late. I mentioned this blog and my psychologist didn&#8217;t think that it was necessarily a good idea. He made a good point about me creating the blog out of a need to feel in control of something which is not a motivation that leads to any sort of lasting change. I can think of some other reasons to keep it going, but I definitely can&#8217;t just sit around waiting for something to fix me. Anyways, it&#8217;s very possible that this blog will be taken offline after nine or ten posts only having been seen by me. I think it more likely that I will edit some of the existing posts and then post less often and only when I have something to say.</p>

<h4>Reasons to keep this blog going</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reporting daily gives me a level of accountability.</li>
<li>I suck at consistently doing certain daily tasks.</li>
<li>The daily posts without worrying about being perfect have the potential to improve my abilities as a writer.</li>
<li>I think the daily data collection is useful for tracking certain things and I don&#8217;t think I will keep it up if I&#8217;m not posting it online.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think it&#8217;s possible that my psychologist would have seen the blog differently if I had presented it more as a daily journal and less as a means of publicly publishing personal information. Anyways, I&#8217;ll keep thinking on it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, this was my least effective day yet, but I don&#8217;t feel too bad about it. It was Sunday which is a day I typically earmark for rest and getting my mind off of the work/study/etc. of the week. However, I <em>did</em> pretend to be sick to get out of social obligations. I&#8217;ve been getting over a cold, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly bad enough. My anxiety, however was at the point where the only thing that could relieve it was deciding not to do things. Also, I slept in past noon which is probably going to have repercussions on this next week especially as I try to make it to my appointment with my psychologist in seven hours. I took some NyQuil to help me sleep earlier, but There&#8217;s definitely no guarantee that I will fall asleep soon or wake up at a normal time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think more and more that I need more structure and I should try to get a full-time job. I have more to say about this, but I don&#8217;t really want to think about it now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, today was Saturday, so I don&#8217;t feel too bad about it being a near-complete loss. I woke up and helped take down the Christmas lights and then I laid in bed all day watching TV and playing Portal 2. I know this is going to sound like laziness to some people, but my anxiety today was debilitating. I already have planned in my head a few versions of white lies to get me out of my next couple social obligations. I never know how to come back from this kind of thing. The only solution seems to be to blow off enough things that the seemingly unbearable load shrinks. I&#8217;m actually not really sure if I&#8217;m supposed to be able to come back from this type of situation quickly. It seems like most of my therapy has been geared towards prevention. Anyways, I have an appointment with my psychologist for Monday morning at 8 AM which I&#8217;m just now realizing I might blow off. This sucks. I know that when I get back from talking to my therapist I always feel better about things, but I just can&#8217;t imagine myself feeling good enough to go see him Monday morning. Complicating things is the fact that I almost certainly will not be awake at 8 AM on Monday.</p>

    <link href="http://halfnobody.github.com/blog/2013/01/04/report-day-4/"/>

    <id>http://halfnobody.github.com/blog/2013/01/04/report-day-4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow. Today was bad. I let the little things slide to the point where I had a fairly bad anxiety attack. I felt drawn to self-destructive behaviors. I wanted to drive WAY too fast and eat unhealthy food past the point of being full. I wanted to lay in bed and watch TV and play video games and surf the internet to try to stuff my mind with so much content that I would be able to forget about what a failure I&#8217;ve been.</p>

<p>The thing about feeling like this is I think I would be totally fine if I could just do everything in my life perfectly. If I could make every decision correctly the first time, I would never be awkward and I would never feel anxious. I could be confident and self-assured and 100% positive that I had done everything I could in exactly the right way. Being imperfect, however, means that I rethink and second-guess all my good decisions and my bad decisions devastate me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I found a free personal time punch clock program that should allow me to keep track of my time and help me be more productive. I was actually surprised that there wasn&#8217;t a better solution out there. I would be interested in a clean program with a nice interface (think github for windows) that would not only keep track of my time to various projects, but block certain time-wasters (facebook, reddit, um&#8230; iwastesomuchtime&#8230; etc.) while I&#8217;m &#8220;on the clock.&#8221; I might look into writing this sort of thing myself, but I need to focus on paying projects right now.</p>

<p>The day wasn&#8217;t a total loss, however. I came home from work to a nice dinner and Raiders of the Lost Ark on TV. Karen Allen is in all probability my long-lost, time-shifted soul mate. Once I invent time travel, I will save young her from her tedious and boring Hollywood life and introduce her to the glamour of being a programmer&#8217;s wife. Temple of Doom is on now. That&#8217;s a bit of a drag.</p>

    <id>http://halfnobody.github.com/blog/2013/01/04/report-day-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was an OK day. I got to work a little late, but I immediately completed my Project01 task in about ten minutes. I then wasted a few hours before having a quality afternoon working on Project02. I probably had four hours of effective work in about seven hours at the office. I was hoping to find some productivity software that would allow me to clock in and clock out and formalize the accounting of my time. I never got around to it, so I will have to do that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I also looked on Craigslist and applied for other &#8220;gigs&#8221; in town. I&#8217;m hoping to pick up some more temporary work that will enable me to make a few dollars and gain some experience with different types of projects. At the very least, I&#8217;ll get better at applying for jobs and meeting new people, which is something I should be better at than I am.</p>

<p>This evening I played basketball for a couple hours which was nice. My current weight makes it quite hard on my legs and knees, but I have to start somewhere. It was a bit rough because I still have a bit of a cold, but I was able to get up and down the court OK.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not going to put my weight in the individual reports anymore as it is much easier to input and use if I put them in a spreadsheet. You can find this under the <a href="http://halfnobody.github.com/goals">Goals tab</a> above.</p>

<p>Today was an OK first day back at work. My boss had no work for me today, so all of my time was self-directed time. I spent a good chunk of the morning working on tasks for Project01, but I was working in a task-based manner instead of a time-based manner, which wasn&#8217;t ideal. I accomplished the tasks without losing too much focus. In the afternoon, I did SEO and Adwords research for Project02 and I learned some interesting things about SEO from chapter 4 of the seomoz beginner&#8217;s guide. I did this in a time-based manner, but it was quite difficult and I didn&#8217;t stop at the time that I had decided to stop. This time-based task completion is much easier said than done.</p>

<p>All in all, I probably had about three hours of effective time in the six or so hours I was at the office. Tomorrow I will look for some kind of productivity widget that will allow me to clock in and clock out to more successfully measure my productive time.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t accomplish much today. I have a bit of a cold and I had the day off. I got this blog up and running and I helped take down Christmas decorations, but other than that, I just stayed in bed reading things on the internet and watching TV all day. I also did a fair amount of thinking about my goals which I will write about in another post. That is all.</p>

    <link href="http://halfnobody.github.com/blog/2013/01/01/good-riddance/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-01T02:12:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://halfnobody.github.com/blog/2013/01/01/good-riddance</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to come right out and say it. 2012 was not a great year for me. I got broken up with, I &#8220;temporarily&#8221; moved back in with my parents, had an anxious breakdown, and got fired due to not accomplishing much of anything for an extended period of time (somewhat due to the breakdown). I made progress on, but ultimately failed to complete, two different independent study courses that were to serve as a proof-of-concept for my ability to go back to school and finish up my degree. I got just involved enough with my ex-girlfriend for her to be able to break up with me twice more, gained 20 pounds, and ran out of money.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When I allow myself to reflect, I find that 2012 provided a couple of silver linings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am physically healthy. (Well, actually, I have a bit of a cold <em>right now</em>, but I expect to make a full recovery.)</p></li>
<li><p>I found a psychologist who seems to actually know what he&#8217;s doing and care about fixing my mental problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The TV show Breaking Bad was pretty great.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As the year reached its end and I began to reflect upon the goals that were not accomplished by me in 2012, I realized that I am seriously lacking in nearly every important area of my life and if I don&#8217;t organize my many goals, I will never achieve them. This realization, followed by a few days of pondering, led to this post (and hopefully many more). I have broken down the areas of my goals into the following outline. This is not a perfect representation, but if I wait until perfection to post, I will never post.</p>

<ul>
<li>Happiness

<ul>
<li>Family

<ul>
<li>Marriage</li>
<li>Current Family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Career

<ul>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Experience</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spirituality

<ul>
<li>Study</li>
<li>Prayer</li>
<li>Rendering Service</li>
<li>Regularity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fun

<ul>
<li>Car</li>
<li>Sports</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve broken down my ultimate goal of &#8220;Happiness&#8221; into four areas. These are things that I know have the capacity to make me happy and need to be balanced somewhat. These areas are further broken down into more specific groups that help me see if activities I take part in are actually contributing to my happiness. The next tier, if I were to model it in its entirety, would consist of dozens, if not hundreds of different goals that could all contribute in some way to my happiness. However, I think the current list I have enables me to take a stab at a few of the goals that might have a more immediate effect. The goals I will attempt to focus on include the following:</p>

<h3>Physical Fitness</h3>

<p>This feels cliche. Who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have a New Year&#8217;s resolution or goal to be in better shape? I believe that by improving my physical fitness through exercise and consuming healthier food that I can improve my ability to pursue fulfilling relationships that could lead to marriage (family). Being in better shape will also improve my enjoyment of sports (fun) and my confidence to make new friends (fun). This improvement in confidence should also help me gain experience in networking which has great potential to improve my future career prospects. I&#8217;ve yet to hammer out the details of this goal area, but physical fitness will be an emphasis for 2013.</p>

<h3>Making More Money Now</h3>

<p>I am currently in a position where I make very little money. I have a sporadic part-time job that pays most of my (nearly nonexistent) bills, but I often feel trapped by my financial circumstances. This significantly lowers my self esteem and raises my stress as I have a car that is breaking down, a rising monthly health insurance bill, and no safety net for any other emergencies. I also need money to afford to go back to school when I&#8217;m ready. Most people in my situation would go and get a full-time job, but I am not mobile (due to working with my therapist) and I&#8217;m honestly not sure if I could handle regular deadlines and commitments right now.</p>

<p>This leaves me with the option to pick up side projects and odd jobs to bring in spending cash and ideally help me gain experience for my future career. Most of my short-term &#8220;making money&#8221; initiatives are actually detrimental to my long-term career potential as it is very difficult to get short part-time work doing complicated programming with no experience and no degree.</p>

<p>OK, so I obviously don&#8217;t have the whole &#8220;making more money now&#8221; thing all planned and figured out, but it will help my &#8220;fun&#8221; and my &#8220;education&#8221; and my &#8220;marriage&#8221; prospects and if I can get it to overlap with &#8220;career,&#8221; then that would be great.</p>

<h3>Stay Busy and Useful</h3>

<p>Part of the reason I have trouble making money is that I waste hours and hours a day on most typical days. One symptom of my anxiety disorder is that my brain tries to avoid excitement and discouragement by actively changing the subject to anything more bland and mundane. When I&#8217;m working on something and I get excited due to a period of success or (more often) discouraged due to things not working quite how I&#8217;d like, I find myself almost automatically navigating to Facebook, Hacker News, or Reddit and wasting a bunch of time. Sometimes I can enter something of a comatose state and not realize that hours have passed since the last time I did anything useful. In my current situation, this is not a detriment to my employer, as I only bill him for successful hours. However, it is something that needs to change if I am to achieve the success I desire in my life.</p>

<p>One strategy for dealing with this symptom (as taught to me by my psychologist) involves setting out blocks of time where I only do one thing. For example, I often have five or ten different useful projects to work on I switch between them frequently and randomly. This can at times make me feel like a super multitasking ninja, but I rarely finish any of the projects. Often I will go to the office for ten hours and find that only one of those hours was productive and the productive hour occurred in sixty one-minute increments scattered throughout the day. If I block out one half an hour at a time and resolve to only work on one project in that half an hour, I will be more productive. I have had some success doing this in the last couple of months, but it is difficult to stick to as it is tedious and goes against my wilder tendencies.</p>

<p>A good metric to help gauge my progress in this area would be to document my useful time every day compared to my wasteful time. Hopefully I will get some nice data as this ratio improves. This is probably the most important thing I can do to improve most of my goal areas.</p>

<h3>Tracking Progress</h3>

<p>I plan to submit a daily report to this blog at the end of the day every day documenting my successes and failures. I have never before been able to maintain a daily journal of any type for longer than a week or two, so it&#8217;s very possible that a handful of posts on this blog will stand forever as a tribute to me once again failing to follow through with a good idea. Hopefully, however, this blog will provide a record of my progress and be something that I can slap my name on and show to future employers as evidence of my ability to overcome my struggles.</p>
