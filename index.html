  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, this reporting thing isn&#8217;t really working. Today sucked again. I got up on time to make it to my appointment a little bit late. I mentioned this blog and my psychologist didn&#8217;t think that it was necessarily a good idea. He made a good point about me creating the blog out of a need to feel in control of something which is not a motivation that leads to any sort of lasting change. I can think of some other reasons to keep it going, but I definitely can&#8217;t just sit around waiting for something to fix me. Anyways, it&#8217;s very possible that this blog will be taken offline after nine or ten posts only having been seen by me. I think it more likely that I will edit some of the existing posts and then post less often and only when I have something to say.</p>

<h4>Reasons to keep this blog going</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reporting daily gives me a level of accountability.</li>
<li>I suck at consistently doing certain daily tasks.</li>
<li>The daily posts without worrying about being perfect have the potential to improve my abilities as a writer.</li>
<li>I think the daily data collection is useful for tracking certain things and I don&#8217;t think I will keep it up if I&#8217;m not posting it online.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think it&#8217;s possible that my psychologist would have seen the blog differently if I had presented it more as a daily journal and less as a means of publicly publishing personal information. Anyways, I&#8217;ll keep thinking on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, this was my least effective day yet, but I don&#8217;t feel too bad about it. It was Sunday which is a day I typically earmark for rest and getting my mind off of the work/study/etc. of the week. However, I <em>did</em> pretend to be sick to get out of social obligations. I&#8217;ve been getting over a cold, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly bad enough. My anxiety, however was at the point where the only thing that could relieve it was deciding not to do things. Also, I slept in past noon which is probably going to have repercussions on this next week especially as I try to make it to my appointment with my psychologist in seven hours. I took some NyQuil to help me sleep earlier, but There&#8217;s definitely no guarantee that I will fall asleep soon or wake up at a normal time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to think more and more that I need more structure and I should try to get a full-time job. I have more to say about this, but I don&#8217;t really want to think about it now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, today was Saturday, so I don&#8217;t feel too bad about it being a near-complete loss. I woke up and helped take down the Christmas lights and then I laid in bed all day watching TV and playing Portal 2. I know this is going to sound like laziness to some people, but my anxiety today was debilitating. I already have planned in my head a few versions of white lies to get me out of my next couple social obligations. I never know how to come back from this kind of thing. The only solution seems to be to blow off enough things that the seemingly unbearable load shrinks. I&#8217;m actually not really sure if I&#8217;m supposed to be able to come back from this type of situation quickly. It seems like most of my therapy has been geared towards prevention. Anyways, I have an appointment with my psychologist for Monday morning at 8 AM which I&#8217;m just now realizing I might blow off. This sucks. I know that when I get back from talking to my therapist I always feel better about things, but I just can&#8217;t imagine myself feeling good enough to go see him Monday morning. Complicating things is the fact that I almost certainly will not be awake at 8 AM on Monday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow. Today was bad. I let the little things slide to the point where I had a fairly bad anxiety attack. I felt drawn to self-destructive behaviors. I wanted to drive WAY too fast and eat unhealthy food past the point of being full. I wanted to lay in bed and watch TV and play video games and surf the internet to try to stuff my mind with so much content that I would be able to forget about what a failure I&#8217;ve been.</p>

<p>The thing about feeling like this is I think I would be totally fine if I could just do everything in my life perfectly. If I could make every decision correctly the first time, I would never be awkward and I would never feel anxious. I could be confident and self-assured and 100% positive that I had done everything I could in exactly the right way. Being imperfect, however, means that I rethink and second-guess all my good decisions and my bad decisions devastate me.</p>

<p>Anyways, I found a free personal time punch clock program that should allow me to keep track of my time and help me be more productive. I was actually surprised that there wasn&#8217;t a better solution out there. I would be interested in a clean program with a nice interface (think github for windows) that would not only keep track of my time to various projects, but block certain time-wasters (facebook, reddit, um&#8230; iwastesomuchtime&#8230; etc.) while I&#8217;m &#8220;on the clock.&#8221; I might look into writing this sort of thing myself, but I need to focus on paying projects right now.</p>

<p>The day wasn&#8217;t a total loss, however. I came home from work to a nice dinner and Raiders of the Lost Ark on TV. Karen Allen is in all probability my long-lost, time-shifted soul mate. Once I invent time travel, I will save young her from her tedious and boring Hollywood life and introduce her to the glamour of being a programmer&#8217;s wife. Temple of Doom is on now. That&#8217;s a bit of a drag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was an OK day. I got to work a little late, but I immediately completed my Project01 task in about ten minutes. I then wasted a few hours before having a quality afternoon working on Project02. I probably had four hours of effective work in about seven hours at the office. I was hoping to find some productivity software that would allow me to clock in and clock out and formalize the accounting of my time. I never got around to it, so I will have to do that tomorrow.</p>

<p>I also looked on Craigslist and applied for other &#8220;gigs&#8221; in town. I&#8217;m hoping to pick up some more temporary work that will enable me to make a few dollars and gain some experience with different types of projects. At the very least, I&#8217;ll get better at applying for jobs and meeting new people, which is something I should be better at than I am.</p>

<p>This evening I played basketball for a couple hours which was nice. My current weight makes it quite hard on my legs and knees, but I have to start somewhere. It was a bit rough because I still have a bit of a cold, but I was able to get up and down the court OK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not going to put my weight in the individual reports anymore as it is much easier to input and use if I put them in a spreadsheet. You can find this under the <a href="http://halfnobody.github.com/goals">Goals tab</a> above.</p>

<p>Today was an OK first day back at work. My boss had no work for me today, so all of my time was self-directed time. I spent a good chunk of the morning working on tasks for Project01, but I was working in a task-based manner instead of a time-based manner, which wasn&#8217;t ideal. I accomplished the tasks without losing too much focus. In the afternoon, I did SEO and Adwords research for Project02 and I learned some interesting things about SEO from chapter 4 of the seomoz beginner&#8217;s guide. I did this in a time-based manner, but it was quite difficult and I didn&#8217;t stop at the time that I had decided to stop. This time-based task completion is much easier said than done.</p>

<p>All in all, I probably had about three hours of effective time in the six or so hours I was at the office. Tomorrow I will look for some kind of productivity widget that will allow me to clock in and clock out to more successfully measure my productive time.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t accomplish much today. I have a bit of a cold and I had the day off. I got this blog up and running and I helped take down Christmas decorations, but other than that, I just stayed in bed reading things on the internet and watching TV all day. I also did a fair amount of thinking about my goals which I will write about in another post. That is all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to come right out and say it. 2012 was not a great year for me. I got broken up with, I &#8220;temporarily&#8221; moved back in with my parents, had an anxious breakdown, and got fired due to not accomplishing much of anything for an extended period of time (somewhat due to the breakdown). I made progress on, but ultimately failed to complete, two different independent study courses that were to serve as a proof-of-concept for my ability to go back to school and finish up my degree. I got just involved enough with my ex-girlfriend for her to be able to break up with me twice more, gained 20 pounds, and ran out of money.</p>
